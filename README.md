# Assembly-Language-Beast
This is my final project of assembly languages course,and it's a RPG.<br>
It's is very  similar to my java final project, but I improved the maze generation algorithm, and removed the minimap<br>
I tried to link .obj files generated by C/C++ and masm<br>
Using gcc, masm, makefile, SDL to create this game
